In this article, we'll implement our own signals.

## What are signals

Signals are objects that incapsulate access to
their original value and track dependencies that
use these signals.

## Yes but why?

The goal of this post is to have fun
and to create the basic understanding
through practice of how such things *can* work.

## Real world signals examples

### Vue

In vue3, there are two main reactivity primitives: ref and reactive.
They're not called signals in vue, but they're the same.
From the [documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth.html#connection-to-signals):

>Fundamentally, signals are the same kind of reactivity primitive as Vue refs.
>It's a value container that provides dependency tracking on access,
>and side-effect triggering on mutation.

Vue automatically tracks dependencies that use refs or reactive objects,
and triggers re-render or re-computation (if we talk about such
thing as [`computed`](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html)) when their value is changed.

Additionally, vue provides 'watchers'(`watch`, `watchEffect`), which run callback
functions any time their 'watched' value has been changed. In code
it looks this way:

```ts
const name = ref('name')

watch(name, (newName) => {
  console.log(newName)
})
```

### S.js

In S.js, signals are created with the `S.data` function.
To change the signal's value, you call signal as a function
with an argument, and you call signal without arguments
to get its current value:

```js
const name = S.data('Andrew')
name('Saphir')
console.log(name()) // prints 'Saphir'
```

S.js has the `on` method, which is identical to vue's
`watch`:

```js
const counter = S.data(0)

S.on(counter, () => {
  console.log('The counter has been changed')
})
```

## Design signals

Our signals will work as in the [S.js](https://github.com/adamhaile/S) library -
`createSignal()` function will return a function that can be
used as a setter when we provide a new value, and as a getter when called without arguments:

```js
const userName = createSignal('User13')

console.log(userName()) // prints 'User13'

userName('User')
console.log(userName()) // prints 'User'
```

### Update value with function

For simple values like strings or numbers
changing values by simply passing them as arguments
is ok, but for more complex types it may
be too verbose. Imagine a `user` object with a complex
structure like this:

```
const user = {
  name: 'User13',
  age: 44,
  email: 'user13@mail.com',
  created_at: '2024-01-01',
}
```

To update one property, we have to pass a new
value to a signal:

```js
const signal = createSignal(user)

signal({
  name: 'User02',
  age: 44,
  email: 'user13@mail.com',
  created_at: '2024-01-01',
})

console.log(signal().name) // 'User02'
```

We can, hovever, simplify this by using spread operator and signal as a getter:

```js
const signal = createSignal(user)

signal({
  ...signal(), // Will return the current object
  name: 'User02',
})
```

Looks better, yet we can make it better - pass a callback function with one
parameter - current signalâ€™s value, and assign result as a new value:

```js
const signal = createSignal(user)

signal(u => ({
  ...u,
  name: 'User02',
}))
```

Or with simple types:

```js
const signal = createSignal(3)

signal(v => ++v)

console.log(signal()) // prints '4'
```

### Track signal changes 

Signals as containers for values are not very useful, though. We
want to be able to perform some actions when signal's  value
changed. For this, we'll create a function named `on`:

```js
const s = createSignal(12)

on(s, (newVal) => {
  console.log(`New value is ${newVal}`)
})

s(13)
s(v => v++)
```

What we expect from this code? It should print these two lines:

```
New value is 13
New value is 14
```

## Implementation

First thing that we'll create is a function that acts differently depending
whether it's called with arguments or without them. For this, we need
the [arguments object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments).

```js{hl_lines=2}
function signal(param) {
  if (arguments.length === 0)
    console.log('Without arguments')
  else
    console.log('With arguments')
}

signal() // 'Without arguments'
signal(23) // 'With arguments'
```

Note that we can't check `param` for `undefined`, because in this
case we won't be able to distinct `signal()` and `signal(undefined)` calls:

```js
function signal(param) {
  if (param === undefined)
    console.log('Without arguments')
  else
    console.log('With arguments')
}

signal() // 'Without arguments'
signal(2) // 'With arguments'

// Oh no! It prints 'Without arguments'!
signal(undefined) // 'Without arguments'
```

### `createSignal`

For keeping the same state between signal function calls we'll wrap our state variable in a closure.

```js
function createSignal(value) {
  let _value = value

  function signal(v) {
    const isSetter = arguments.length > 0

    if (isSetter) {
      if (typeof v === 'function') {
        _value = v(_value)
      } else {
        _value = v
      }
    } else {
      return _value
    }
  }

  return signal
}

const name = createSignal('Anna')
console.log(name()) // 'Anna'
console.log(name('Tanya'))
console.log(name()) // 'Tanya'
```

And that's it, our signal is ready.
It's simple, but it works! And it also works with functions, as we planned:

```js
const user = createSignal({ name: 'Anna', age: 41 })
user(u => ({...u, name: 'Tanya'}))
console.log(user().name) // 'Tanya'
console.log(user().age) // 41
```

### `on` function

This function takes a signal and a callback that should be executed
when the signal is changed. At this point, we should think
about few things:

1. We need some data structure to store callbacks
2. We need to modify the signals' implementation and execute required
   callbacks when a signal is executed as a "setter".

Data structures go first. We'll use `Map` with signals as its keys and
array of callbacks as its values. It will allow us to quiclky find
required callbacks. This map should
be global for the whole module:

```
const effects = new Map()
```

```js
function on(signal, cb) {
  const signalEffects = effects.get(signal)

  if (signalEffects) {
    signalEffects.push(cb)
  } else {
    effects.set(signal, [cb])
  }
}
```

Very simple, isn't it? We just push the callback
to the array of already existed callbacks if it
exists. If not, we create a brand new array with just
one value - our callback.

Finally, we need to find these callbacks
and execute them in our signals. This is the code that implements it:

```ts
// Find registered callbacks
const signalEffects = effects.get(signal)
if (signalEffects) {
  for (const cb of signalEffects) {
    cb(newSignalValue)
  }
}
```

## What's next? 

I plan to write one more post which will introduce
a few improvements to our current signals, so stay tuned in!

## Full source

```js
const effects = new Map()

function ss(value) {
  let _value = value

  function signal(v) {
    const isSetter = arguments.length > 0

    // TODO: check for equality and don't trigger effects
    //       when the actual value has not been changed
    if (isSetter) {
      if (typeof v === 'function') {
        _value = v(_value)
      } else {
        _value = v
      }

      // Find registered callbacks
      const signalEffects = effects.get(signal)
      if (signalEffects) {
        for (const cb of signalEffects) {
          cb(_value)
        }
      }
    } else {
      return _value
    }
  }

  return signal
}

function on(signal, cb) {
  const signalEffects = effects.get(signal)

  if (signalEffects) {
    signalEffects.push(cb)
  } else {
    effects.set(signal, [cb])
  }
}
```

## Let's do something with our signals

For demonstration purposes, let's create a simple web page
with a button and a counter for the number of times the
button was clicked.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			const counter = createSignal(0)

			function onClick() {
				counter(v => ++v)
			}

			window.addEventListener('load', () => {
				const btn = document.querySelector('button')
				// Display initial counter's value in the button
				btn.innerText = counter()

				// On each click, increment counter value
				btn.addEventListener('click', onClick)

				// Every time when the counter was changed,
				// update button text with the new value
				on(counter, (newValue) => {
					btn.innerText = newValue
				})
			})
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<button> </button>
	</body>
</html>
```
