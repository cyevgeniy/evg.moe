[Far2l](https://github.com/elfmz/far2l) is a port of Far Manager v2
that runs on Linux and Mac.

<!--more-->

## Installation

On Linux distros, first search for `far2l` package. If it's not
awailable, you have to build it by yourself.

On macs, use the `brew` package manager:

```
brew install --cask far2l
```

## Usage

Interface is pretty the same, but of course `far2l` is not so
much powerful as original Far Manager.

Basic commands for file manipulations are the same as in Far:

- `Tab` - jump between left and right panels
- `F5` - Copy file under cursor/selection to the opposite panel
- `F6` - Move file under cursor/selection to the opposite panel
- `Shift-F5` - Create copy of a file file in the same panel
- `Shift-F6` - Rename current file
- `Enter` - open file
- `Shift+arrows up/down` - select files
- `F3` - View file under cursor
- `F4` - Edit file under cursor

## Development state

As of 2024, far2l seems actively developed.
