## Good parts

- Good out of the box support for a large variety
  of archives
- Free

## Bad parts

- Works only on Windows, because uses Win API
- Current Major version of Far Manager is 3. Version 2 was
  far more lightweight
- Now it hasn't an option for turning on "Black and white"
  colorscheme.
- Ugly default "Blue" color that makes you sick
