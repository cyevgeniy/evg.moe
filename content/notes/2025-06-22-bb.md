**GOOD DAY TO YOU, SIR**

>Legend has it, that a man by the name of Roger Tellenfield was walking by one of his friends one day. His friend looked over and said "I am having a good day". Roger was having a horrible day so he pulled out a gun stuck it to his own head and said "Well good day to you sir" and shot himself. Since then this phrase has been used by many as a good way to end a fight or a good way to say good bye.

I Read about this legend in a translator's note (Russian) in the "Sea of Poppies" book.
