Essentially my Sublime text setup requires only three things:

- Terminus - terminal emulator right in the editor. The nice thing is that you
  can open terminal in a special panel, or you can open a terminal in a new tab.
- Sublime LSP - LSP support
- WordingStatus - Shows words count and statistics for a document.
