Very useful feature of Emacs: You can bookmark directories and files
and switch between them quickly.

To add the current dired directory to bookmarks, press
`M-x r m` in dired, then type bookmark name.

To add bookmark to a file, use the same keystroke in a window with a file.

To jump to a bookmark press `M-x r l`, move to required
bookmark in the list and hit `enter`.
