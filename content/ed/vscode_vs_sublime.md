I found a few things that VSCode does better than Sublime Text.

<!--more-->

## Creating new files from the sidebar

When you create a new file in the sidebar file navigator, VSCode
asks for a filename first, and only then opens the file itself.
In Sublime Text, after clicking on "New File" context menu item,
new tab is opened, and you type a filename only when saving.
Creating a file first is better, because in this case  your file
will have an extension, and proper mode and syntax highlighting
will be used when you'll start writing.

## Sidebar position

In VSCode, the sidebar can be moved to the right side.
This is very useful when you often toggle the sidebar (on small screens,
for example) - in this case your code is not shifted to the right
side each time the sidebar is shown.
