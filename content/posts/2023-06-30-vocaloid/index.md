Vocaloid is a music genre where voice is synthesized
with a software.

 It's named so because
of the [Vocalid](https://www.vocaloid.com/en/) software,
made by Yamaha, which synthesizes singing voices.

She is very popular, people go to her concerts,
there are a lot of fan stuff with her - figures, posters, t-shirts, you name it.
She's not the only one or first virtual voice characters, by the way.
[MEIKO](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/MEIKO), for example, was
released three years before Miku.
