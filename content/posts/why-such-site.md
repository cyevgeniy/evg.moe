This site represents my opionated views on how
blogs should *not look like*, mainly:

- If they don't provide interactive elements for learning purposes,
  they should be fully static
- They should be minimized to the max (thanks to the tools like
  LightningCSS, hugo etc it's very easy)

I use hugo to build my blog. And with hugo, it's pretty trivial to
minimize css and html.
