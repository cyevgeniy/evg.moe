If you don't write a math book, you probably
don't need Latex. Just install [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/),
create a document in LibreOffice Writer,
then click `File - Export as - Export directly as PDF`.

That's all, and you don't need to:

1. Install Latex
2. Install a **TON** of packages/fonts/language packs for it.
3. Read answers on latex forums/stackoverflow (stackexcahange) for hours
   just to be able to generate a PDF file.
4. Learn unintuitive markup language, time for learning which will never
   pay off.
