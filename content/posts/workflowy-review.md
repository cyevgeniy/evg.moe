In this post I'll tell about my experience with Workflowy -
famous outliner service, which I've been using for half
a year at the moment of writing.

<!--more-->

## Why

I don't suffer from information gathering much, but I have
pretty minimal needs - sync bookmarks, keep some text
notes and todo items. I used to keep bookmarks with
Firefox sync mechanism and my text notes/todo items with the
help of [protectedtext](https://protectedtext.com) (which is
a great service!). But because firefox became unusable,
I switched a browser from Firefox to Vivaldi on a smartphone,
while on a laptop I was still using firefox. That broke my
bookmarks workflow, and at that moment I had two bookmark
lists, and each of them was living its own life.
What about notes? - I was happy with how I dealt with them, but
it changed over time because of bad usability on a smartphone.
I tried a lot of note management tools (Trello, TickTick, Notion, Org mode,
Simplenote, Standardnotes, Google Keep), but finally I've picked Workflowy.
The main reason was that I thought that I would be able to adopt it for all my
needs (And strictly speaking, I succeed at this). I was using
it for less than a month before I bought PRO subscription. Now the story
begins...


## Interface (Desktop)

Workflowy has a great UI. It's clean and consistent, what else
do I need? In general, nothing. There are some issues
with the mobile app - I'll list them in the next section.

Here, it's worth mentioning DynaList - a clone of Workflowy,
which in my opinion has a terrible user interface:

## Interface (Mobile)

This is a list of my issues with the mobile interface:

- I just can't tap on those small arrows to expand a node
- Slow and draggy animation

Everything else is very nice.

## Keyboard shortcuts

I had been using only mouse for the first few months, but when I
tried to use a keyboard, I was thrilled. Now,
on desktop/web platform, about half of my
actions are done with a keyboard. You can always
toggle the help panel with shortcuts in three steps:

1. Click options button
2. Pick "Settings"
3. Toggle the "help me learn the keyboard shortcuts"

My day to day shortcuts are:

- `Ctrl` - `arrow up/arrow down` - Expand/collapse a node
- `Alt` - `arrow left/arrow right` - Zoom out/zoom in
- `Ctrl` - `Alt` - `m` - Move a node
- `Ctrl` - `Enter` - Mark a node as completed
- `Ctrl` - `Shift` - `Backspace` - delete a node
- `Shift` - `Enter` - Add a new node

## Slow startup

On a smartphone, the application starts very slow.
I hate it when I take the smartphone to write out
a quick note and have to wait more than 5 seconds for
application to be loaded. Any default note taking
application starts in a moment on any android device, and such slow
Workflowy's start speed is very irritating.
I'm not the only one who have faced with this - there's a
[ticket with this problem](https://workflowy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4412153194900-Loading-time-too-long-). The support says that 10-15 seconds for startup is "expecting"
and "pretty standard for now".

In the march of 2023, Workflowy [announced](https://blog.workflowy.com/harder-better-faster-stronger-significant-startup-speed-improvements/) "Significant speed improvements" of
load time - now it's 40% less in average. However, I personally haven't
noticed any speed improvements - maybe this is because I have a very small
amount of list items, while they seem like they have boosted load time
only for accounts with a large number of nodes, I don't know.

## Complex content

Workflowy is an outliner. It's poorly suited
for rich content with images, paragraphs, tables etc.
With this service, you should consider every node
as one single, atomic block of the whole text. Do you
want to insert an image? Create a node. Need a list?
Create a node for each item. Want to split some notes into
paragraphs? You know what to do. And this way of working
with documents may be unacceptable for people who
want to use Workflowy for writing long text and
complex documents.

## Kanban

They're selling  it as the feature that
would incline Trello users to make a switch to Workflowy.

I think this is silly. Trello sucks, but if someone uses it,
Workflowy's unintuitive kanban implementation will just
enhance his attachment to Trello.

## Summary

In summary, I like Workflowy, but I'm afraid that the team
will be adding more and more features to it in pursuit of
new users, and as a result, Workflowy will become everything,
and nothing. Will I renew my subscription? Definitely not -
I don't use it heavily enough to pay for it.
