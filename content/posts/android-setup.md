A list of android apps I can recommend.

<!--more-->


## OLauncher

- [Google Playmarket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher&hl=en_US)
- [Github](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher)

If you want a simple and elegant android launcher, [Olauncher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher&hl=en_US)
is for you. It removes all icons from the screen and allows you to add just 5 applications to the main
screen. These apps are displayed as text - no icons. You can swipe up to see the full list of applications.
Also supports swipe customization - for example, you can set left swipe to open contacts, and 
right to launch the camera.


## Markor

- [Download from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.gsantner.markor/)
- [Github](https://github.com/gsantner/markor)

Markor is a markdown editor with a lot of additional features, such
as support for [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) format, export to pdf, html and image
formats (and yet it's not all available formats). Todotxt support is great - 
markor can move completed tasks to the archive file, so your todo.txt will be always
clean. The "quick notes" feature is also a great idea - basically it's just a
simple markdown file, but in the app you have a separate button to open it quickly.

## DroidFS

- [Download from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/sushi.hardcore.droidfs/)
- [Github](https://github.com/hardcore-sushi/DroidFS)

DroidFS allows you to create an encrypted container, where you can put all sensitive
stuff. Supports wiping imported files from the phone memory.

## Etar

A good calendar app. Nothing more, nothing less.
