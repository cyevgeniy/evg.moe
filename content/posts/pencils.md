TL;DR: I use a mechanical pencil (~~0.9mm~~ 0.7mm) for writing right now.

As I wrote [earlier](/posts/pilot_pens), I'm a huge proponent of pens and paper.
And I never thought that there's anything that can be used for writing but pens.


Until recently. I was in the kitchen and needed to write down a note to myself on a sticky note.
I couldn't find a pen and grabbed a kids' mechanical pencil that had been there for years, I believe.

Surprisingly, I enjoyed the feeling of a lead scrapping paper, the color and changing line width.
As with fountain pens, there's something meditative and calming.

During the next few days I had been using the pencil exclusively and I liked it more and more.
After briefly lurking on the Internet, I decided to try a 0.7mm lead, will see how it feels.
Most probably I'll get one more addiction.
