I've been an almost happy workflowy's user for about a year,
and as [I wrote earlier]({{< ref "/posts/workflowy-review" >}}) , I'm done with workflowy.
Yesterday, I read their privacy policy more carefully, and, you
know, it's full of gems, check it out:

<!--more-->

Under the **2. Data that we use, receive, collect, process, share or store and how we may use it**,
they have a few nice points:

>2.1.2. We might use, receive, collect, process or store Personal Data
>on potential customers, customers, employees, service providers,
>users of the Services and the Website, etc.

>2.1.3.8. AS MOST OF THE DATA IS PROVIDED BY THE USER OF
>THE SERVICES WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE, PROVIDE OTHER
>CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA, SPECIFICALLY “SENSITIVE”
>AND “SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF DATA” (AS DEFINED BY GDPR i.e.
>medical data, financial data, political opinions, religious data,
>childrens’ data etc ) IS UNDER THE USER’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY
>AND OWN RISK AND WE RECOMMEND NOT PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF DATA.

LOL, What kind of data I supposed to keep safe in Workflowy then?

And another one:

>2.1.4.3. Internal business: We may use your Personal Data for
>internal business purposes, including, without limitation, to
>help us improve our Services, Website content and functionality,
>to better understand our customers and users, to protect against,
>identify or address wrongdoing, to enforce our contracts and
>this Privacy Policy, to provide you with customer service
>and to generally manage and operate our business
>(e.g., pay salaries and make considerations).

WTF is "Internal business purposes", huh?

And this is for all users - even for those who have paid money.
Oh my god, they suck so hard.

*I know that almost all online web services have similar
privacy policies, I just wrote about one of them.*
