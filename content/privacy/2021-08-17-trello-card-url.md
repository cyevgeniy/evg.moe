There is one reason why I don't use Trello for personal
tasks, and it is the card URLs - they have the same name as
the card title.

For example, suppose I have a board with my personal tasks,
and in this board I have a card "Call mom". The URL of this
card will be something like `trello.com/blah-blah/blah-blah-call-mom`.

What is wrong with this? Well, if you and only you(and always only you)
use the computer from which trello is usually launched, then it is not a
problem at all. But if someone else has access to your browser, or maybe
a friend has gave you his laptop for a while, and you have used it to launch Trello
in a browser, then you have a problem: even if you logged out, the browser's
history will contain all urls which you have visited.

— (*you*) Hey Johny, can I use your laptop for five minutes, just need
  to have a look at my today's tasks.
  
— (*Johny*) Yeah, of course.

— (*you logging in, watch your tasks, click on some cards to see theirs
  description, logging out*) Thank you, Johny.
  
— (*Johny opens the browser, wants to open some web-site, for example
  theguardian.com. He presses "t", and browser pop-up recent history urls.
  Sadly, Trello also starts with "T". Johny sees this*:

Johny did not ask you to inform him about this.
